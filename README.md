# 100Data: A Comprehensive Guide to 100 Biostatistics Datasets â€” Cleaning, Exploration, Modeling, and Visualization

**100Data** is an in-depth project aimed at addressing **complex biostatistics datasets** through a structured workflow of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and the implementation of **efficient, interpretable machine learning models**. The project centers on **100 challenging datasets**, including gene expression profiles, clinical trial data, and patient demographics, offering a systematic approach to deriving actionable insights from raw data. By employing **streamlined, technical models** such as Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and K-Means clustering, we demonstrate how scalable and reproducible machine learning techniques can be effectively applied to real-world biostatistics challenges.
